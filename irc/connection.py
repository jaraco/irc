    A class for creating custom socket connections.

    To create a simple connection:

        server_address = ('localhost', 80)
        Factory()(server_address)

    To create an SSL connection:

        Factory(wrapper=ssl.wrap_socket)(server_address)

    To create an SSL connection with parameters to wrap_socket:

        wrapper = functools.partial(ssl.wrap_socket, ssl_cert=get_cert())
        Factory(wrapper=wrapper)(server_address)

    To create an IPv6 connection:

        Factory(ipv6=True)(server_address)

    Note that Factory doesn't save the state of the socket itself. The
    caller must do that, as necessary. As a result, the Factory may be
    re-used to create new connections with the same settings.
