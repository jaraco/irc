    <h1>Python IRC library (AKA python-irclib AKA irclib.py)</h1>

    <p>
      Please see the
      <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/python-irclib/">Project pages</a>
      (where you can
      <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/python-irclib/">download</a>
      the library) for information about the project.
    </p>
    <p>
      This library is intended to encapsulate the IRC protocol at a
      quite low level.  It provides an event-driven IRC client
      framework.  It has a fairly thorough support for the basic IRC
      protocol, CTCP and DCC connections.
    </p>
    <p>
      In order to understand how to make an IRC client, I'm afraid you
      more or less must understand the IRC specifications.  They are
      available here:
    </p>
    <p>
      <a href="http://www.irchelp.org/irchelp/rfc/">http://www.irchelp.org/irchelp/rfc/</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Requirements:

      <ul>
        <li>Python 1.5.2 or newer.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      Installation:

      <ul>
        <li>Run "python setup.py install" or copy irclib.py and/or
        ircbot.py to an appropriate Python module directory.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      The main features of the IRC client framework are:

      <ul>
        <li>Abstraction of the IRC protocol.</li>
        <li>Handles multiple simultaneous IRC server connections.</li>
        <li>Handles server PONGing transparently.</li>
        <li>Messages to the IRC server are done by calling methods on an IRC
	connection object.</li>
        <li>Messages from an IRC server triggers events, which can be caught
	by event handlers.</li>
        <li>Reading from and writing to IRC server sockets are normally done
	by an internal select() loop, but the select()ing may be done by an
	external main loop.</li>
        <li>Functions can be registered to execute at specified times by the
	event-loop.</li>
        <li>Decodes CTCP tagging correctly (hopefully); I haven't seen any 
	other IRC client implementation that handles the CTCP specification
	subtilties.</li>
        <li>A kind of simple, single-server, object-oriented IRC client class
	that dispatches events to instance methods is included.</li>
        <li>DCC connection support.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      Current limitations:
      
      <ul>
        <li>The IRC protocol shines through the abstraction a bit too much.</li>

        <li>Data is not written asynchronously to the server (and DCC
	peers), i.e. the write() may block if the TCP buffers are
	stuffed.</li>
        <li>The author hasn't studied the new RFCs (2810, 2811, 2812
        and 2813) very closely.</li>
        <li>Like most projects, documentation is lacking...</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      Enjoy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since I seldom use IRC anymore, I will probably not work much on
      the library.  If you want to help or continue developing the
      library, please contact me.
