	* ircbot.py:
	* irccat:

	Code modernization - String methods used instead of deprecated
	string functions, keyword 'in' used for membership testing instead
	of 'has_key' method, etc.

2005-12-06  Keltus <keltus@users.sourceforge.net>
	* irclib.py (ServerConnection.process_data): Reversed fix from
	2005-05-28. This is strange because there was a bug before and
	now it's gone. Either python changed something, or the IRC
	networks changed something. Confirmed by peter.

2005-11-03  Keltus <keltus@users.sourceforge.net>
	* irclib.py (numeric_events): Renamed numeric code 332 from topic
	to currenttopic (the message when "/topic <chan>" is sent), so it

	* irclib.py (ServerConnection.disconnect): Fixed infinitely

2005-08-18  Keltus <keltus@users.sourceforge.net>

	disconnect would ignore the quit message, but now it sends a quit
	message and disconnect. Suggestion by Erik Max Francis.
	* ircbot.py: Changed to use ServerConnection.disconnect instead of
	ServerConnection.quit as well.

2005-05-28  Keltus <keltus@users.sourceforge.net>
	* irclib.py (ServerConnection.process_data): Fixed quit arguments

	Preparations for version 0.4.5.

2005-04-26  Keltus <keltus@users.sourceforge.net>
	* irclib.py (IRC.__doc__): Corrected server.process_forever() to
	irc.process_forever(). Suggestion by olecom.

2005-04-17  Keltus <keltus@users.sourceforge.net>
	* irclib.py (ServerConnection.process_data): Moved event
	translation code.
	* irclib.py (ServerConnection): Reverted the 2005-01-28 change
	because it breaks jump_server().

	* irclib.py: (ServerConnection): Moved
	self.irclibobj._remove_connection call from	close() to
	disconnect(). Patch from Alexey Nezhdanov.

	"Changing servers" (more ubiquitous quit phrase)
